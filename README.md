# Vehicle Detection and Number Plate Recognition 🚗🔍

Welcome to my project! This GitHub repository contains an exciting project that combines the power of YOLO8, sorting algorithms, and EasyOCR to detect vehicles, track their number plates, and extract the characters from the number plates. 🚗💨

## Project Overview 📝

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Utilize YOLO8, an advanced object detection algorithm, to accurately detect vehicles in images or video streams. 🚘🔍
2. Train the YOLO8 model specifically for detecting vehicle number plates, improving the accuracy of recognition. 🚀
3. Implement efficient sorting algorithms to track vehicles and their corresponding number plates over time. 🚦
4. Leverage EasyOCR, a powerful optical character recognition library, to extract characters from the detected number plates. 🕵️‍♂️

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/project1.git. 📥🖥️
2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. ⚙️
3. Open the respective Jupyter Notebooks and execute the code cells to understand the implementation details and run the experiments. 🔬
